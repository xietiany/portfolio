                    <h1>Bachelor Degree</h1>
                    <p>During my undergraduate education, I pursued a double major in data science and quantitative finance. My aspiration is to become a quantitative researcher in finance, thus I dedicated my studies to a diverse range of fields including computer science, statistics, mathematics, and finance. My focus on these areas stems from a desire to build a strong foundation and acquire comprehensive skills that are essential for thriving in the dynamic landscape of quantitative finance research.</p>

                    <h1>Master Degree</h1>
                    <p>Throughout my master's degree program, I delved deeply into the study of quantitative finance, building upon the foundation laid during my undergraduate studies. I immersed myself in technically rigorous courses, exploring subjects such as computational data science and parallel computing. These advanced courses provided me with the specialized knowledge and skills necessary to tackle complex financial models and data analysis tasks effectively.</p>

                    <h1>Graduate Student Instructor</h1>
                    <p>During my graduate studies, I took on the role of a graduate student instructor, providing invaluable guidance to my peers. I led discussion sections once a week, aimed at offering fundamental instruction on parallel computing tools, including MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA. Through these sessions, I sought to enhance understanding and proficiency in utilizing these advanced tools for parallel programming, enabling students to effectively harness the power of parallel computing in their research and projects.</p>

                    <h1>Risk Quantitative Analyst</h1>
                    <p>After graduating from the University of Michigan in July 2020, I joined Citi. Over the course of four years at the company, I made significant contributions to three key quantitative risk models: DSFT, IDL, and GSST retail. Each of these models was designed to address a specific set of risks, spanning market risk, counterparty risk, default risk, and the forecasting of potential losses under extreme stress scenarios. My involvement in these projects allowed me to deepen my understanding of risk management practices and refine my skills in quantitative modeling and analysis within the dynamic financial landscape of Citi.</p>

                    <h1>CFA/FRM Charterholder</h1>
                    <p>Driven by my innate self-motivation, I pursued further professional qualifications in my spare time, demonstrating my commitment to continuous self-improvement. I successfully completed the rigorous CFA Level 3 and FRM Level 2 exams, showcasing my dedication to mastering the intricacies of finance and risk management. It was a moment of pride when I finally obtained my charterholder licenses for both CFA and FRM in 2024 and 2022, respectively. These achievements not only validate my expertise and knowledge in the field but also reflect my relentless pursuit of excellence in my career journey.</p>
